# Konsolenfisch

## Terminal Goldfish Simulator

This project is a simple simulation of a goldfish living in your terminal.

*   **Terminal-Based:** Runs entirely within your terminal, no graphical interface required.
*   **Lightweight:** Minimal resource usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
